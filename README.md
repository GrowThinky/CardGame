## Bohnanza (Card Game) 

This is a simple game, based on the card game "Bohnanza". 
It's a project I did for a Software Design class last semester and all code was written by me, 
except for the GUI Class, wich was provided by my professor for the class. 

## How to play: 

I am mostly justr trying to show some code I've written. 
But If you want to see the game in action, just run the "main" Method in the Package io.bitbucket.plt.sdp.bohnanza
and select "Base Game" in the title screen.
