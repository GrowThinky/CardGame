## Bohnanza (Card Game) 

This is a simple game, based on the card game "Bohnanza". 
It's a project I did for a Software Design class last semester and all code was written by me, 
except for the GUI Class, wich was provided by my professor for the class. 

## How to play: 

This is mostly just to show some code I've written - the game is not fully functional. 
But If you want to see the game in action, just run the "main" Method in the Package io.bitbucket.plt.sdp.bohnanza
and select "Base Game" in the title screen. 

## I will continue working on the game over the next few weeks, to maybe arrive at a more polished version. :)
